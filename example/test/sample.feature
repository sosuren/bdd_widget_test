    Background:
        Given the app is running
    
    After:
        # Just for the demo purpose, you may write "I don't see {'42'} text" to use built-in step instead.
        # See the list of built-in step below.
        And I do not see {'42'} text 
    
    # @testMethodName: testGoldens
    Scenario: Initial counter value is 0
        Then I see {'0'} text

    Scenario: Add button increments the counter
        Given I am in home page
        When I tap {Icons.add} icon
        Then I tap {Icons.add} icon
        And I should see {'2'} text

    # Scenario: Built-in steps
    #     And I don't see {Icons.add} icon
    #     And I don't see {'text'} rich text
    #     And I don't see {'text'} text
    #     And I don't see {Container} widget
    #     And I enter {'text'} into {1} input field
    #     And I see disabled elevated button
    #     And I see enabled elevated button
    #     And I see exactly {4} {Container} widgets
    #     And I see {Icons.add} icon
    #     And I see multiple {'text'} texts
    #     And I see multiple {Container} widgets
    #     And I see {'text'} rich text
    #     And I see {'text'} text
    #     And I tap {Icons.add} icon
    #     And I wait
